# Deploy an Image classification website with Ngrok

<p align="justify">
The source code in this repository is a website generator built with Python and ngrok for image recognition tasks. This basic program is designed to help you understand how to implement AI models on websites, and we hope it supports you on your journey to explore artificial intelligence.

## Ngrok
<p align="justify">
Ngrok is a tool that allows developers to expose a local server to the internet by creating secure tunnels. It provides a public URL, which can be used to access a web application running on your local machine from anywhere in the world. This is particularly useful for testing webhooks, sharing development work, or demonstrating projects without needing to deploy them. Ngrok also offers features like request inspection, replaying requests, and access control, making it a versatile tool for local development and debugging.

## Image Classification
<p align="justify">
<strong>Image classification</strong> is a fundamental problem in computer vision where the goal is to assign a label or category to an image based on its content. This task is critical for a variety of applications, including medical imaging, autonomous vehicles, content-based image retrieval, and social media tagging.
